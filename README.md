# Object-Oriented-Programming-Task

The objective of this task was to produce a program with object oriented principles and implement a “Nearest Neighbour Search” algorithm.

The program uses Nearest Neighbour Search (NNS) to unshuffle a shuffled image in C++.
Because images are 2D matrices, the implementation of the NNS algorithm is based on th Matrix Class.

The images are in .txt format, each pixel is represented by a value from 0 – 255 representing a greyscale colour.
